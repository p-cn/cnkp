> #### Wanna build something like this?
> This site is built with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz). Locally it's managed by [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
> 
> The font I use is [Golos Text](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Golos+Text).

>**Helpful guides to set up:**
>- [Nicole van der Hoeven's guide](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/How+to+publish+Obsidian+notes+with+Quartz+on+GitHub+Pages) is a well-written guide for beginners as Quartz's original guide can be a bit overwhelming for mortals (like me).
